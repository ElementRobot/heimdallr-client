# Walkthrough
This tutorial should demonstrate most of the functionality of Heimdallr-Client. This walkthrough will demonstrate using Heimdallr-Client in node.js. Heimdallr-Client can also be used in the browser and is available as a bower package. The authentication keys are fake so copy-pasting the code will not work. To get your own authentication keys simply contact [us](mailto:heimdallr@elementrobot.com).

## Getting Started
Install [node](http://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it. Then make a directory for your Heimdallr project to live in and grab the node packages we will be using:

```bash
mkdir heimdallr-project
cd heimdallr-project
npm install heimdallr-client request --save
```




```javascript
